                        Need to borrow a van? Don’t pay for cover you don’t need
                    </h2>
                    <p >No matter how long you’re borrowing a vehicle for – even if it’s just for one journey – it’s the law that you must be properly insured to drive it. But the insurance policies your used to can only be taken out by the year, while adding someone to an existing policy can be a long, drawn-out and costly process. So, is there an alternative?</p>
                    <h3 className="mb-2">Can I insure a van for a week?</h3>
                    <p className="my-4">Yes, you can. 1 week van insurance is a great way to get fast and flexible insurance.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">There are several reasons why you might need to borrow or use a van. You could be clearing a house, or your own van might be in for repairs. Whatever the situation, borrowing a van from a friend, colleague or family member is often the best way to do the jobs that your own vehicle just isn’t big enough for.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">Sorting out insurance for this can be time-consuming, and if you only need van insurance for a week you might think it’s not worth the hassle, but using a vehicle that you are not already insured to drive is illegal and you could face an unlimited fine. The simplest way to avoid a fine and get the cover you actually want is to purchase 7 day van insurance.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">Unlike an annual policy, it’s flexible and works around your schedule, so you only pay for when you actually need it. It’s separate to any existing policies you or the van owner has, so you don’t have to worry about it affecting your no claims discount.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">Driving a vehicle that is unfamiliar and often larger than your own can be a daunting prospect, but with one week van insurance, you get comprehensive cover. So, if the worst should happen, you have peace of mind knowing that everyone is protected.</p>
