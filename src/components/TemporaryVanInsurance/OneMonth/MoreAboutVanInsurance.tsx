                    <p >There are lots of reasons you might need to use a van for a short while, from moving home to keeping your business on the go. But when you get behind the wheel of any vehicle, you must ensure you’re properly insured to do so. In your circumstances, the annual policies you’re used to seem wasteful – they provide much longer cover than you need, and you’ll end up paying for it. But there is an alternative.</p>
                    <h3 className="mb-2">So can I insure a van for just a month?</h3>
                    <p className="my-4">Yes, with a&nbsp;temporary insurance&nbsp;policy you’re able to get 1 month van insurance quickly and easily.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">While it shouldn’t be seen an alternative to annual insurance, if you’re one of the many drivers who want to use a van temporarily, then a one month policy could be the ideal way to save time and money.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">Buying 28 day van insurance is a cost-effective way to get cover for the duration you want, without having to worry about adjusting existing policies&nbsp;(if you’re borrowing a van)&nbsp;or paying for a whole years’ worth of cover if you’re only using the van for short period of time.</p>
                    <h3 className="my-4">What if a month still seems like too long?</h3>
                    <p className="my-4">Not only can you buy a monthly policy, but with temporary insurance, you can get cover for a duration that suits you.</p>
                    <p className="my-4"> From just&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tempcover.com/temporary-van-insurance/one-day" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one day</a>, up to 28 days, you can find a policy that means you don’t have to pay for any cover that you don’t need.</p>

                    <p className="mb-2">Buying monthly van insurance has never been easier. You can buy a policy online at any time and it takes just a few minutes.</p>
                    <p className="mb-2">When you buy a one month van insurance policy, you’ll need to answer a few basic questions about you and the van you want to drive. You’ll need to enter your name, date of birth, occupation, address, and driving history. These are to give the insurer an idea the type of driver you are and where you’ll be using the vehicle.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">If you’re borrowing a van or using a vehicle you’re not familiar with, be sure that you know the body type of the van and it’s UK registration number before getting a quote, because you won’t be able to get one without it. And If you want to add an additional driver to the policy, you’ll need to have their details to hand before you start.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">Once you’ve entered your information and selected the duration and start time you want, you’ll be presented with a range of quotes to compare.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">From there you simply select the policy you like best and enter your payment details.</p>

                    <p className="my-4"> The whole process of getting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tempcover.com/temporary-van-insurance/one-day" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">short term van cover</a> is straightforward, and takes around two minutes.</p>

                        What does monthly van insurance cover me to do?
                    </h2>
                    <p className="mb-2">One month van insurance is ideal for a range of jobs and circumstances, so whether you’re driving a van for work or borrowing one while yours is in for repairs, short term cover will keep you on the move.</p>
                    <p className="mb-2">Everyday journeys like going to the shops or driving your kids to school are known in the insurance world as social, domestic and pleasure use. These are considered standard journeys and are covered by all insurers.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">Most insurers we work with will also cover you for journeys relating to your trade or business. This can include commuting, transporting large items or generally getting around while on the clock.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">That being said, because we work with a panel of insurers who each have their own acceptance criteria, there are some things you won’t be insured to do with a monthly van insurance policy.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You won’t be able to use the van to transport people or goods for hire or reward. This generally refers to taxis, couriers, hauliers, or furniture removers. Your insurance policy won’t be valid if you are moving people or goods for a fee.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You may not be able to transport hazardous materials or drive in what the insurer describes as hazardous locations.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p className="my-4"> If you are unsure about any of the restrictions be sure to check your 1 month van insurance&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tempcover.com/temporary-van-insurance/one-day" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">policy wording document</a> which you’ll receive once you’ve purchased the policy.</p>
