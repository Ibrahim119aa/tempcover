                        Can I get one hour van insurance?
                    </h2>
                    <p className="my-4">There are some jobs where only a van will do, so if you need to borrow a van from a mate or family member or want to add an additional driver to a van you’re going to borrow, you’ll need to make sure you’re legal to do so first.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">To begin with, you’ll have to check you have the right kind of licence. But you also need to have insurance in place to be able to drive the van. It’s a requirement by law, and there are very serious consequences if you’re caught without it, so it’s never worth the risk.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">There are a few ways you can go about this. You could see if your annual policy will cover you to drive another vehicle. There’s every chance that your insurer won’t allow it though, particularly driving a larger vehicle like a van. And even if they do agree, you may only be offered third party cover, which leaves you vulnerable.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">You could arrange for whoever owns the van to name you on their annual policy. But this takes days and weeks to sort out – no good if you need the van at short notice – and they’ll probably be charged fees. They’d also be likely to see their premium go up plus, they could risk losing their No Claims Discount, should the worst happen and you had to make a claim.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">You could also look into getting an annual policy of your own, but if you only need a van for a few hours, this would be a massive waste of your time and money.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">In most cases, hourly van insurance will be the best option. Its ideal for such a short term borrow or additional driver, as you only pay for the amount of cover you need – no more, no less. You’re not tied into any contracts; you just pay for your cover upfront, set your start time and you’re good to go. You could have a policy in place in under 5 minutes, making it perfect for those last-minute van requirements.</p>


                    <h3 className="my-4">What if I need to insure a van for longer?</h3>
                    <p className="my-4">If you think your van use requirements are going to push the top end of 12 hours, it may be more economical and less risky to just take out a longer policy. If your job overran, you could be left without cover and would be unable to drive, so you might want to give yourself some legroom.</p>
                    <p className="my-4"> In that case you can always get&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tempcover.com/temporary-van-insurance/one-day" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one day van insurance</a>,or even up to &nbsp;<a href="https://www.tempcover.com/temporary-van-insurance/one-day" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">weekly van insurance</a></p>

                        Why get hourly van insurance?
                    </h2>
                    <p className="mb-2">There are lots of scenarios where hourly van insurance could be your best way forward, but some of the more common include.</p>
                    <h3 className="my-3">If you’re moving home</h3>
                    <p className="mb-2">Even the best-planned of house moves can be a minor logistical nightmare. Getting all your possessions from A to B is no small task at all, but the more carrying capacity you have the quicker it’ll take – so it makes perfect sense to borrow a van. And this can turn out cheaper than calling in the professionals.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">But if you’d like to do it yourself, you’ll need van insurance in place. Since you’ll only need to use the vehicle for a handful of hours, it really wouldn’t be worth paying for any more cover than you need. Thankfully, our hourly van insurance does exactly what you need it to. You’ll be legal to drive the van for how ever many hours you specify, getting fully comprehensive cover and protecting yours and the owner’s no claims discount in the process.</p>


                    <h3 className="my-3">If your commercial van is in for repairs</h3>
                    <p className="mb-2">Vans are the lifeblood of millions of British businesses. But breakdowns can happen at any time, and you never truly know what your annual MOT could uncover.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">Your van may have to stay off the road and head to the garage for the day, but that doesn’t mean you can just let business stop, particularly if you have appointments, targets and deliveries. In this case you’ll need to borrow a van – either another in your fleet or someone else’s.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">With &nbsp;<a href="https://www.tempcover.com/temporary-van-insurance/one-day" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">temporary business van insurance</a> by the hour, you can keep to schedule. You only pay for the hours you need, and you’re not tied into anything once the policy expires and you’ve got your own van back.</p>

                    <h3 className="my-3">If you need to transport a large item</h3>
                    <p className="mb-2">Just found a bargain second-hand sofa online? Or taking some home renovation work into your own hands and need to pick up a door or two? Not everything comes flatpack, and sometimes your car’s boot just won’t do.</p>
                    <p className="my-4">In these situations, you’ll need to get your hands on a bigger vehicle, and van insurance by the hour from Tempcover lets you do just that. If you’re only making one short trip, it makes no sense at all to faff around altering existing policies, or getting locked into any arrangements. With temporary van insurance, just tell us when you want your insurance to start and end. It’s particularly great if you make a last minute purchase of a large item, because you could have your policy in place in as little as five minutes.</p>
