                                <h2>Why use one-day van insurance?</h2>
                                <p>Temporary van insurance is a quick and straightforward option when you need cover for a short period of around 24 hours...</p>
                                <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
                                    <li>Moving house and you need to drive for a day or two.</li>
                                    <li>The van that you need for work is in for repairs.</li>
                                    <li>Carrying one-off large items.</li>
                                    <li>Insuring a new employee for a short period.</li>
                                    <li>Transporting family members to university.</li>
                                    <li>Test-driving a new van.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p className="my-2">Because of the flexibility of temporary van insurance, it’s perfect for domestic or business use. Most of us don’t have a van to hand but getting the right insurance to borrow one is simple and straightforward with 1-day van cover.</p>
                                <p className="my-2">It’s also ideal for small businesses, van fleets and tradespeople because one-day van insurance is so quick and easy to buy. Even if you need it at the last minute, you can rely on it.</p>
