                <p>
                  If you&nbsp;insure a van for a day, you get all the comprehensive cover of a yearly policy without the hefty price tag.
                  Annual insurance is time-consuming and expensive – it may work out cheaper per day but you’ll end up paying far more
                  for cover that you just don’t need.
                </p>
                <p className="my-2">
                  One-day van insurance&nbsp;is a cost-effective option with long-term benefits.&nbsp;Temporary van cover&nbsp;will
                  generally last for&nbsp;24 hours&nbsp;and is separate, standalone policy so the owner of the van’s No Claims Discount is
                  protected and there are no long-term contracts. This means that you’re not tied to anything.
